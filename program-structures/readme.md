# program-structures Theory
On this module I have to go in deep on how functions, naming, conditionals and iterations works. I will do it for the following languages: `JavaScript`, `Java`, `PHP`, `Go`, `Python`, `C#`. 

## Naming Rules
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

### Advantages
* to provide additional information about the use to which an identifier
* to help formalize expectations and promote consistency within a development team
* to enable the use of automated refactoring or search and replace tools
* to enhance the aesthetic and professional appearance of work product
* to help avoid "naming collisions"
* to provide meaningful data to be used in project handovers and better understanding

### Disadvantages
* Each programming language uses it's own convention
* Could be challenging to agree on a common naming
* Automatic process could fail or underperform if not followed

### Flat case
`flatcase` and `UPPERFLATCASE` are not commonly used as the readability is not really good when you have to deal with multiple words naming.

### Camel Case
`camelCase` borns in order to improve the readability of flat case convention. Is commonly used in JavaScript and java to name variables which are not constants. It's also used to name brands or products such as `iPhone` or `eBay`.  

### Pascal Case
`PascalCase` is commonly used to name Pascal, Java and JavaScript class and interface files.

### Snake Case
`snake_case` used in python to name variables, functions and methods. Personally I like this naming a lot as readability is very good.
`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` also known as `MACRO_CASE` is a good practice to name constant variables and C processor macros.

### Kebab Case
`kebab-case` doesn't have a defined convention but on my personal case I like to use it for folder and repository naming.
`TRAIN-CASE` is the same concept but with capitalized letters.
`HTTP-Header-Case` is an extended convention to name HTTP request headers.

## Reserved words and keywords
**Reserved words** are words that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of  a variable, function, label ... This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no meaning.
**Keywords** are reserved words as a string of characters will unambiguously be either a keyword or an identifier, usually a subset of reserved words.

### JavaScript
```js

## Scope and Variable types
the strict definition of scope is  the portion of source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies. Said in other words is the fraction of the code on which an identifier is accessible. Depending on the scope we can classify different variables:

* **Local Variables**: Exists only in a specific function execution time.
* **Autogenerated Variables**: are variables which are generated and removed automatically when the function ends
* **Global Variables**: are accessible since the start until the end oof the execution of the program 
* **Extern Variables**: are shared variables cross files
* **Constant Variables**: are variables which value is immutable and can not be modified

## Comments
Are used to improve readability and simplifies the future understanding of the code. The best practices required to make the code self-readable and self-explanatory. Comments if used must always provide extra value. Comments can be single-line or multiple-line.  

### JavaScript
```js
// this is a single-line comment in JavaScript.

/*
This is multiple-line
comment in JavaScript.
*/
```

### Java
```java
// this is a single-line comment in Java.

/*
This is multiple-line
comment in Java.
*/
```

### Python
python is an exception as it doesn't support multiple-line comments

```python
# This is a single-line comment in Python

# This is a how
# multiple-line comments 
# in Python looks like
```

### Go
```go
// this is a single-line comment in Go.

/*
This is multiple-line
comment in Go.
*/
```

### PHP
```php
// this is a single-line comment in PHP.

/*
This is multiple-line
comment in PHP.
*/
```

### C#
```c#
// this is a single-line comment in C#.

/*
This is multiple-line
comment in C#.
*/
```

## Functions
In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value

### Parameters vs arguments
**Parameters:** are variables in a method or function definition
**Arguments:** is the given data to a function when it is called

### Return Values
Are just what they sound like — the values that a function returns when it has completed.
`return` keyword is usually used to store the output of a function in a variable of the upper scope.

### JavaScript
```js
// ES5 function declaration
function fooFunction(parameter1, parameter2) {
    // method body

    return; // some value
}

//ES6 arrow function declaration as constant with template literal return
const fooArrowFunction = (...arguments) => {
    // method body

    return; // some value
}

//this is how invocation in JavaScript works
fooFunction(argument1, argument2);
fooArrowFunction(argument1, argument2);
```

### TypeScript
TypeScript enhance JavaScript and introduce the ability to set the type of the expected returned value.    
```ts
let myAdd = function (x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
};

myAdd(number1, number2) // We already know it will be a number
```

### Java
```java
// This is the schema of how to declare Java functions
returnType methodName(param) {
  // method body

  return; // return data of type returnType
};

methodName(argument); // This is how invocation in Java works
```

### Python
```python
def fooFunction(param1):
    # method body

    return # return some data
```

### Go
```go
func avg(x float64, y float64) float64 {
    // method body

	return (x + y) / 2 // return  some data
}
```

### PHP
On a PHP file it's possible to run also plain HTML code so we need to add the `<?php ?>` tag in order to run the PHP code
```php
<?php
function fooFunction() {
  echo "Hello world!";
}

fooFunction(); // call the function
?>
```

### C#
```c#
// General schema on how functions are declared
<Access Specifier> <Return Type> <Method Name>(Parameter List) {
   Method Body
}

class NumberManipulator {
   public int FindMax(int num1, int num2) {
      /* local variable declaration */
      int result;

      if (num1 > num2)
         result = num1;
      else
         result = num2;

      return result;
   }
}
```

## Loops vs Iterators
The difference is quite subtle indeed. Both loops and iterators are used to repeat a chunk of code. Loops are an ancient idea, they existed long before computers did. Almost every programming language has some kind of loops. Iterators are relatively new, and they only exist in a few languages such as Ruby.

* **Loops:** are both powerful and dangerous: it’s too easy to break your program by producing a so called infinite loop, if you fail to ensure that the termination condition really occurs.
* **Iterators:** are conceptually used to perform a task on each data item.
